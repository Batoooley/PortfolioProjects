The astronomer used to go out at night to observe the stars.#
One evening, as the astronomer wandered through the suburbs with his whole attention fixed on the sky, he fell accidentally into a deep well.#
The astronomer lamented and bewailed his sores and bruises, and cried loudly for help.
The neighbour ran to the well.#
On learning what had happened, the neighbour said:  "Hark ye, old fellow, why, in striving to pry into what is in heaven, do you not manage to see what is on earth?"
